# Flatpak App with Bundled GNOME Shell Extension — Implementation Plan

## Goal
Ship a Flatpak application that optionally installs a GNOME Shell extension for desktop integration, in a way that:
- Is accepted by Fedora / Flathub reviewers
- Respects GNOME Shell security and UX rules
- Requires explicit user action
- Works cleanly on Wayland (GNOME 45+)

The app is primary. The extension is optional.

---

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- The GNOME Shell extension **must not auto-install**
- The extension **must not auto-enable**
- No system-wide writes
- No modifying `/usr` or `/app/share/gnome-shell/extensions`
- No silent Shell manipulation
- Extension must do nothing if the app is not present
